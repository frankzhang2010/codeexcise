QUESTIONS

Does the solution work for larger graphs?
No, there is some size limit for the array.
Can you think of any optimizations?
The problem for undirected graphs will be resolved by parallel optimal longest path search 
What’s the computational complexity of your solution?
Since this method utilized depth first search. The time complexity is O(V+E), V represents the number of vertices and E represents the number of edges in the graph.
Are there any unusual cases that aren't handled?
For some dynamic weight issue, it needs to be handled. 
Feel free to provide a README.md with comments on the implementation.

Additional questions to think about:

What are some things you don’t like about Java?
there is no delegate in java. 
If you could choose any language/framework/technology stack, what would you choose and why?
I will choose java , python language and spring cloud , spring boot ,Django framework, k8 contain system and aws cloud system.
Python was widely used in many area , such as AI, deep learning, web crawler and data analyze
Java is a high-level , class-based , oop language which is widely used in many area
